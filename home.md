## Accomodation for Disabilities
Above all else, we honor your humanity and respect your privacy. You are not required to self-disclose your disabilities. Since not all disabilities are recognized by Disability Services, please know we are willing to support you and accommodate as much as possible.

"If you need accommodations for a disability, it is recommended that you submit an accommodation letter from Disability Services. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment.  Information on requesting accommodations is located on the Disability Services website. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or dsinfo@colorado.edu for further assistance.  If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Medical Conditions under the Students tab on the Disability Services website."

## Classroom Behavior
Data science and qualitative data analysis has always been an evolving field, making us constant learners. We aim to honor us as co-learners as we grow in this area together.

"Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy.  Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.  For more information, see the policies on classroom behavior and the Student Code of Conduct."
